### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy"** button
2. Wait for the build process (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Vercel will show build logs in real-time

### Step 6: Access Your Live Demo
Once deployment is complete:
1. Vercel will provide a live URL like: `https://ca-lobby-demo-xxx.vercel.app`
2. Click the URL to view your live demo site
3. Test the functionality:
   - Dashboard should load automatically (no login required)
   - Navigate to Search and Reports sections
   - All features should work with mock data

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

**âœ… Live Demo Features:**
- California Lobbying Transparency Dashboard
- Advanced search interface with 3 tabs

- Potential users for feedback
- As a portfolio piece
- For demonstration purposes

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all files were committed to GitHub
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly

**If site loads but features don't work:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API routes are accessible at `/api/`
