## 🔧 Phase 2 Plan: Backend Development

### Objective
Create Flask API with comprehensive endpoint coverage

### API Structure Plan
```
webapp/backend/
├── api/
│   ├── auth.py         # Authentication endpoints
│   ├── dashboard.py    # Dashboard statistics and activity
│   ├── data.py         # Core data retrieval functions
│   ├── export.py       # Data export functionality
│   ├── reports.py      # Report generation endpoints
│   └── search.py       # Advanced search endpoints
└── app.py              # Flask application configuration
```

### Endpoint Implementation Plan
1. **Authentication API**
   - POST /api/auth/login - User authentication
   - POST /api/auth/logout - Session termination
   - GET /api/auth/me - Current user information

2. **Dashboard API**
   - GET /api/dashboard/stats - Overview statistics
   - GET /api/dashboard/activity - Recent activity feed

3. **Search API**
   - POST /api/search/entities - Entity-based search
   - POST /api/search/filings - Filing document search
   - POST /api/search/financial - Financial data search

4. **Reports API**
   - GET /api/reports/templates - Available report templates
   - POST /api/reports/generate - Create custom reports

5. **Export API**
   - POST /api/export/csv - CSV data export
   - POST /api/export/excel - Excel format export
   - POST /api/export/pdf - PDF report generation

### Mock Data Strategy
- Realistic California lobbying data simulation
- Consistent entity relationships across endpoints
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Time-based activity data generation

---

## 🔒 Phase 3 Plan: Authentication Implementation

### Objective
Implement JWT-based authentication with role-based access control

### User Roles Planned
1. **Guest** - Basic search and view capabilities
2. **Researcher** - Advanced search and limited export
3. **Analyst** - Full search, custom reports, bulk export
4. **Admin** - User management and system configuration

### Authentication Flow Plan
1. User provides credentials through login form
2. Backend validates and returns JWT token
3. Frontend stores token and includes in API requests
4. Backend validates token and extracts user permissions
5. Role-based access control enforced on all endpoints

### Demo Bypass Strategy
- Auto-authentication for stakeholder demonstrations
- Direct dashboard access without login barriers
- Full admin permissions for feature showcase
- Preserved authentication system for production deployment

---

## 🚀 Phase 4 Plan: Deployment Preparation

### Objective
Configure Vercel deployment with comprehensive documentation

### Vercel Configuration Plan
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "webapp/frontend/build/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    },
    {
      "src": "webapp/backend/app.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "webapp/backend/app.py"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "webapp/frontend/build/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Configuration Plan
- FLASK_ENV=production
- JWT_SECRET_KEY=secure-production-key
- USE_MOCK_DATA=true (for demo)
- PYTHONPATH=./webapp/backend

### Documentation Deliverables
1. **VERCEL_WEB_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Step-by-step deployment guide
2. **Environment variable configuration instructions**
3. **Build process documentation**
4. **Troubleshooting guide for common issues**

## 📁 Phase 5 Plan: File Organization

### Objective
Reorganize data processing files and fix all import statements

CA_lobby/
├── Bignewdownload_2.py
├── Bigquery_connection.py
├── Column_rename.py
├── determine_df.py
├── rowtypeforce.py
└── webapp/
```

**After:**
```
CA_lobby/
├── data_processing/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── Bignewdownload_2.py
│   ├── Bigquery_connection.py
│   ├── Column_rename.py
│   ├── determine_df.py
│   ├── rowtypeforce.py
│   ├── upload_pipeline.py
│   └── upload.py
├── webapp/
└── Documentation/
```

### Import Fixes Plan
1. Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py
2. Convert all imports to relative imports within package
3. Update webapp backend to import from data_processing package
4. Test all import statements for functionality
5. Document import patterns for future development

## 🧹 Phase 6 Plan: Repository Cleanup

### Objective
Create comprehensive .gitignore guide and clean repository

### .gitignore Implementation Plan
**Categories to Cover:**
- Python cache files and virtual environments
- Node.js dependencies and build artifacts
- IDE and editor configuration files
- Operating system generated files
- Security-sensitive files (API keys, credentials)
- Build outputs and temporary files

### Repository Cleanup Strategy
1. Identify currently tracked files that should be ignored
2. Remove problematic files from git tracking
3. Implement comprehensive .gitignore patterns
4. Document cleanup commands for future maintenance
5. Establish team guidelines for git hygiene
