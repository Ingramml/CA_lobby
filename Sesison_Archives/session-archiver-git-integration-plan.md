# Session Archiver + Git Integration Plan

**Date**: 2024-09-18
**Project**: CA Lobby - Session Archiver Enhancement
**Type**: Integration Plan

---

## 📋 Overview

This plan outlines how to integrate the session archiver with GitHub commits to create a comprehensive system where every code change is linked to its learning context, making it easy to understand the reasoning behind changes months later.

## 🎯 Integration Possibilities

### 1. Git Hooks Integration
- **Post-commit hook**: Automatically trigger session archiver after each commit
- **Prepare-commit-msg hook**: Auto-populate commit messages with session references
- **Pre-commit hook**: Validate that session documentation exists for significant changes

### 2. Commit Message Linking
- Include session archive references in commit messages (e.g., `session-2024-09-18_1430-feature-xyz`)
- Use standardized commit message format that references session IDs
- Link commits to specific session archive files

### 3. Automated Documentation Flow
- Session archiver can capture git commit hashes during archiving
- Archive files can include "Related Commits" sections
- Cross-reference between session summaries and commit history

### 4. Enhanced Session Archiver Features
- Capture git status/diff information during sessions
- Include commit context in session metadata
- Track which files were modified during each archived session

## 📊 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Session Archiver
1. **Modify session-archiver.md** to include git integration capabilities:
   - Add git commit hash tracking to session metadata
   - Include git diff/status capture in session content
   - Add "Related Commits" section to archive templates

### Phase 2: Git Hooks Setup
2. **Create post-commit hook** (`.git/hooks/post-commit`):
   - Automatically append commit hash to current session tracking file
   - Option to trigger session archiver for significant commits

3. **Create prepare-commit-msg hook** (`.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`):
   - Auto-populate commit messages with session references
   - Include standardized format: `[session-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM] commit message`

### Phase 3: Cross-Reference System
4. **Add session tracking file** (`.claude/session-tracking.json`):
   - Track active session IDs and associated commits
   - Maintain bidirectional linking between sessions and commits

5. **Update archive templates** to include:
   - Git repository state at session time
   - List of commits made during session
   - File change summaries with git context

### Phase 4: Automation Scripts
6. **Create helper scripts**:
   - Script to generate session-to-commit reports
   - Script to find sessions related to specific commits
   - Integration with `gh` CLI for PR descriptions that reference sessions

## 🔄 Enhanced Session Archive Template

```markdown
# Session Archive Template with Git Integration

## Session Metadata
- **Session ID**: session-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-[project-name]
- **Git Branch**: [current branch]
- **Initial Commit**: [starting commit hash]
- **Final Commit**: [ending commit hash]
- **Repository State**: [clean/dirty/staged changes]

## Git Context
### Repository Status at Session Start
```bash
[git status output]
```

### Files Modified During Session
- `file1.js` - [description of changes]
- `file2.py` - [description of changes]

### Commits Made During Session
1. `abc1234` - Initial feature implementation
2. `def5678` - Bug fix for edge case
3. `ghi9012` - Added tests and documentation

### Git Diff Summary
[Key changes made during the session]

## Related Commits
- **Primary Commits**: Links to main commits from this session
- **Follow-up Commits**: Any subsequent commits that build on this work
- **Related PRs**: Pull requests associated with this session
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Git Hooks
```bash
# .git/hooks/post-commit
#!/bin/bash
echo "$(date): $(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> .claude/session-commits.log

# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
#!/bin/bash
if [ -f .claude/current-session ]; then
    SESSION_ID=$(cat .claude/current-session)
    echo "[${SESSION_ID}] $(cat $1)" > $1
fi
```

### Session Tracking
```json
{
  "current_session": "session-2024-09-18_1430-vercel-debugging",
  "sessions": {
    "session-2024-09-18_1430-vercel-debugging": {
      "start_time": "2024-09-18T14:30:00Z",
      "start_commit": "d2cd568",
      "commits": ["abc1234", "def5678"],
      "files_modified": ["vercel.json", "webapp/frontend/package.json"],
      "status": "active"
    }
  }
}
```

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Complete Traceability**: Every code change links back to its learning context
2. **Enhanced Documentation**: Commit messages become more meaningful with session context
3. **Learning Continuity**: Easy to resume work by understanding previous session context
4. **Code Archaeology**: Months later, understand why specific decisions were made
5. **Team Knowledge Sharing**: Session archives become valuable onboarding resources
