# Opening Workflow Guide

**Purpose**: Standardized workflow for project initialization with Claude_files integration
**Usage**: New project setup and configuration automation
**Date Created**: 2024-09-21

---

## Overview

This guide provides multiple execution options for implementing a consistent opening workflow that:
1. **Copies ~/.claude/master-files/** to current project directory (NEW CENTRALIZED SOURCE)
2. **Executes project-setup-script.sh** for project-specific initialization
3. **Creates all subject outlines** in @Claude_files/sub-agents-guide.md
4. **Loads relevant context** from previous sessions and similar projects (ENHANCED)
5. **Provides pattern recommendations** from accumulated knowledge base (NEW)

This workflow ensures consistent project initialization, maintains synchronized documentation across all Claude-assisted projects, and provides intelligent context continuity from previous work.

---

## Execution Options

### Option 1: Manual Three-Step Process
**Description**: Execute each step manually with separate commands

**Steps:**
1. Copy centralized files: "Copy ~/.claude/master-files to current project directory"
2. Execute setup script: "Run project-setup-script.sh from Claude_files"
3. Create subject outlines: "Generate all specialist agent outlines in Claude_files/sub-agents-guide.md"
4. Load context: "Load relevant context from previous sessions"
5. Get recommendations: "Provide pattern recommendations for this project type"

**Pros:**
- Full control over each step
- Customizable per project
- No setup required
- Easy troubleshooting

**Cons:**
- Requires remembering all three steps
- Potential for inconsistency
- Manual effort each time
- Risk of skipping steps

**Best For**: One-off projects, custom initialization needs

---

### Option 2: Shell Script Automation
**Description**: Partially automated with bash script

**Implementation:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# opening-workflow.sh
echo "Running opening workflow..."

echo "1. Copying ~/Github/Claude_files to current project"
if [ -d "~/Github/Claude_files" ]; then
    cp -r ~/Github/Claude_files ./Claude_files
    echo "‚úÖ Claude_files copied successfully"
else
    echo "‚ùå ~/Github/Claude_files not found"
    exit 1
fi

echo "2. Executing project setup script"
if [ -f "./Claude_files/project-setup-script.sh" ]; then
    chmod +x ./Claude_files/project-setup-script.sh
    ./Claude_files/project-setup-script.sh
    echo "‚úÖ Project setup script executed"
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è project-setup-script.sh not found, skipping"
fi

echo "3. Subject outline generation (manual step required)"
echo "Please run: 'Generate all specialist agent outlines in Claude_files/sub-agents-guide.md'"
echo "Opening workflow complete!"
```

**Usage:** `bash opening-workflow.sh`

**Pros:**
- Partially automated file operations
- Reusable across projects
- Error checking included
- Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- Still requires manual outline generation
- Requires script maintenance
- Limited customization

**Best For**: Projects with consistent structure requirements

- **Destination**: `./Claude_files/` in current project
- **Operation**: Complete copy with directory structure preservation
- **Verification**: Confirm successful copy operation and file integrity

### Script Execution Requirements
- **Target**: `./Claude_files/project-setup-script.sh`
- **Permissions**: Auto-grant execute permissions if needed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or failed scripts
- **Logging**: Capture script output for validation

### Subject Outline Generation
- **Target File**: `./Claude_files/sub-agents-guide.md`
- **Content**: All specialist agent definitions and outlines
- **Structure**: Organized by categories (Web Development, DevOps, etc.)
- **Integration**: Compatible with existing sub-agents guide format

---

## Usage Examples

### Option 3 Usage (Recommended)
```
User: "open"

Claude Response:
1. ‚úÖ Copied ~/Github/Claude_files to ./Claude_files (15 files)
2. ‚úÖ Executed project-setup-script.sh successfully
3. ‚úÖ Generated all subject outlines in Claude_files/sub-agents-guide.md
4. üéâ Opening workflow complete - project ready for development
```

### Option 4 Usage (Advanced)
```typescript
// Using general-purpose agent (until custom agents available)
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Execute opening workflow",
  prompt: "Act as opening-workflow-manager and execute complete opening workflow: copy ~/Github/Claude_files + execute project-setup-script.sh + create all subject outlines with status reporting"
})
```

## Best Practices

### Consistency
- Use the exact same prompt/command each time
- Maintain standardized directory structures
- Document any variations or customizations
- Keep centralized Claude_files up to date

### Preparation
- Ensure ~/Github/Claude_files is current and complete
- Verify project-setup-script.sh is executable and functional
- Check target project directory permissions
- Backup existing Claude_files if present

### Validation
- Verify file copy completeness and integrity
- Confirm script execution success
- Check subject outline generation quality
- Validate project structure after workflow

### Maintenance
- Regularly update centralized ~/Github/Claude_files
- Review and improve project-setup-script.sh
- Update workflow documentation as needed
- Sync improvements across all projects

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File copy failures**: Check source directory existence and permissions
2. **Script execution errors**: Verify script permissions and dependencies
3. **Missing ~/Github/Claude_files**: Initialize centralized directory
4. **Outline generation incomplete**: Ensure sub-agents-guide.md template exists

### Error Handling
- Workflow reports success/failure status for each step
- Manual fallback options available for each component
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Recovery procedures for partial failures

### Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Manual file copy if automated fails
cp -r ~/Github/Claude_files ./Claude_files

# Manual script execution
chmod +x ./Claude_files/project-setup-script.sh
./Claude_files/project-setup-script.sh

# Manual outline generation request
"Generate all specialist agent outlines in Claude_files/sub-agents-guide.md"
```
