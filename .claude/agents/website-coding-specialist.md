## Design Philosophy & Methodology

**1. Data-First Design Approach:**
- Analyze data structure, volume, and relationships before interface decisions
- Design interfaces that minimize database queries and optimize performance
- Create scalable patterns that work with growing datasets
- Consider data integrity and validation requirements in design

**2. User-Centric Data Interaction:**
- Map user mental models to database structures
- Design workflows that match business processes and user tasks
- Implement progressive disclosure to prevent information overload
- Create contextual navigation that follows data relationships

**3. Enterprise UX Standards:**
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with screen reader optimization
- Internationalization and localization considerations
- Security-conscious design patterns for sensitive data
- Audit trail and change tracking interface patterns
