  "buildCommand": "cd webapp/frontend && npm run test:pipeline && npm run build",
  "installCommand": "cd webapp/frontend && npm install",
  "framework": null
}
```

### üîí Security Enhancements
- **IP Whitelisting:** Deployment infrastructure bypass for authentication
- **Secure Credential Management:** Environment variables and service accounts

- **Status:** HTTP 401 (Expected - Clerk authentication active)
- **Response Time:** 0.28 seconds
- **Build Size:** 14,335 bytes served
- **Security:** Authentication layer correctly blocking unauthorized access

### ‚úÖ Build System Verification
```bash
# Successful build output:
Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:
  55.51 kB  build/static/js/main.d4916167.js
  477 B     build/static/css/main.c9a888f8.css
```

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Frontend File Recovery (Resolved)
- **Issue:** Missing package.json and src files due to git operations during rollback testing
- **Solution:** Restored files from git history (commit ebaa7ac0d)
- **Recovery Actions:**
  - Restored `package.json` with full dependency tree
  - Recreated `src/App.js`, `src/index.js`, `src/App.css`
  - Added `public/index.html` for complete React setup
  - Verified build success before redeployment

### 2. Bash Script Compatibility (Resolved)
- **Issue:** Associative array compatibility across bash versions
- **Solution:** Replaced with case statement functions for better portability
- **Impact:** Improved cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Vercel Configuration Conflicts (Resolved)
- **Issue:** `functions` property conflict with `builds` property
- **Solution:** Streamlined configuration removing conflicting sections
- **Result:** Clean deployment pipeline configuration
