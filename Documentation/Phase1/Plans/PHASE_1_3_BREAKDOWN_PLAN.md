# Phase 1.3 Documentation Breakdown Plan

**Date Created:** September 24, 2025
**Purpose:** Break down PHASE_1_3_ENHANCED_PLAN.md into smaller, focused documents
**Current Document Size:** 412 lines
**Target:** Modular documentation following granular principles

---

## Current State Analysis

### **Issues with Current Single Document**
- **Too Large:** 412 lines make it difficult to navigate and maintain
- **Mixed Concerns:** Overview, detailed tasks, commit strategies, and risk mitigation all in one file
- **Poor Usability:** Developers must scroll through entire document to find relevant section
- **Version Control Issues:** Changes to one micro save point affect entire document
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Updates require managing large, complex file

### **Document Structure Analysis**
Current PHASE_1_3_ENHANCED_PLAN.md contains:
1. Overview and prerequisites (~50 lines)
2. 8 detailed micro save points (~250 lines total)
3. Success metrics and risk mitigation (~75 lines)
4. Dependencies and next steps (~37 lines)
